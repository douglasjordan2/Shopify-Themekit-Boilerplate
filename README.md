# Shopify Theme Development Boilerplate

- Clone the repo
- Install dependancies
- Update .env with your ThemeKit password, development and production theme IDs, and shop URL.
- Run the `init` command just the first time. Use `dev` command during development and `prod` to deploy to production. You can use NPM or Yarn with this, package.json will detect which one you're using and apply the proper package manager commands during `init`.
